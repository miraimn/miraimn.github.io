<section class="fullbleed-background privacy-section privacy-content-section">
<div class="h-c-page privacy-page">
<p>For your child to have their own Google Account or profile, we may need your permission to collect, use or disclose your child&rsquo;s information as described in this Privacy Notice and the&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/PrivacyPolicy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>. When you allow your child to use our services, you and your child are trusting us with your information. We understand that this is a big responsibility and we work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/FamilyLink/PrivacyNotice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Notice for Google Accounts and profiles managed with Family Link for children under 13 (or applicable age in your country)</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/PrivacyPolicy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;explain Google&rsquo;s privacy practices.

<p class="h-has-bottom-margin h-has-top-margin"><strong>This Privacy Notice does not apply to the practices of any third-party (non-Google) apps, actions or websites that your child may use.

<h2 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--three h-has-bottom-margin privacy-headline">Information that we collect</h2>
<p>Once you grant permission for your child to have a Google Account or profile, their account or profile will generally be treated like your own with respect to the information that we collect. For example, we collect:</p>
<h3 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--five sub-title privacy-headline">Information that you and your child create or provide us with.</h3>
<p class="h-has-bottom-margin h-has-top-margin">As part of the account or profile creation process, we may ask for personal information like first name and surname, email address and date of birth. We collect the information provided by you or your child, such as your online contact details, which are necessary for us to contact you to request consent. We also collect the information that your child creates, uploads or receives from others when using their account or profile, such as when your child saves a picture in Google Photos or creates a document in Google Drive.</p>
<h3 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--five sub-title privacy-headline">Information that we get from your child&rsquo;s use of our services.</h3>
<p class="h-has-bottom-margin h-has-top-margin">We automatically collect and store certain information about the services that your child uses and how your child uses them, such as when your child enters a query in Google Search, talks to Google Assistant, or watches a video on YouTube Kids. This information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 class="sub-title">Your child&rsquo;s apps, browsers and devices</h4>
<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers and devices that your child uses to access Google services, including unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including operator name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your child&rsquo;s apps, browsers and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity and the date, time and referrer URL of your child&rsquo;s request. For example, we collect this information when a Google service on your child&rsquo;s device contacts our servers, like when they install an app from the Play Store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="sub-title">Your child&rsquo;s activity</h4>
<p>We collect information about your child&rsquo;s activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend apps that they might like on Google Play. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/FamilyLink/ManageControls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">choose whether your child can manage their activity controls</a>. Your child&rsquo;s activity information that we collect may include things like search terms, videos that they watch, voice and audio information when they use audio features, people with whom they communicate or share content, and Chrome browsing history that they&rsquo;ve synced with their Google Account. If your child uses our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, for example by using Google Hangouts or Duo, we may collect telephony log information. Your child can visit their Google Account to find and manage activity information that&rsquo;s saved in their account or profile, and you can also help manage their activity information by signing in to your child&rsquo;s Google Account or accessing their profile in Family Link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="sub-title">Your child&rsquo;s location information</h4>
<p>We collect information about your child&rsquo;s location when they use our services. Your child&rsquo;s location can be determined by using GPS, IP address and sensor data from their device and information about things near their device, such as Wi-Fi access points, mobile towers and Bluetooth-enabled devices. The types of location data that we collect depends in part on your settings and your child&rsquo;s devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 class="sub-title">Your child&rsquo;s voice and audio information</h4>
<p>We may collect your child&rsquo;s voice and audio information. For example, if your child uses audio activation commands (e.g. 'Hey Google' or touching the microphone icon), a recording of the following speech/audio, plus a few seconds before, may be stored to their account from any of your child&rsquo;s signed-in devices, when the Web &amp; App Activity setting is enabled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="h-has-bottom-margin h-has-top-margin">We use various types of technology to collect and store your child&rsquo;s information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases and server logs. We do not require your child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to use the Google products and services available for these accounts or profiles.</p>

<h2 class="h-c-headline h-c-headline--three h-has-bottom-margin privacy-headline">How we use information that we collect</h2>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Privacy Policy explains in greater detail how we may use the data that&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/PrivacyPolicy#whycollect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google collects</a>&nbsp;in association with your child&rsquo;s Google Account or profile. In general, we use your child&rsquo;s information: to provide, maintain and improve our services; to develop new services; to customise our services for your child; to measure performance and understand how our services are used; to communicate directly with your child in relation to our services; and to help to improve the safety and reliability of our services.</p>
<p>We use different types of technology to process your child&rsquo;s information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyse your child&rsquo;s content to provide them with things like customised search results and other features tailored to how they use our services. And we analyse your child&rsquo;s content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognise patterns in data. When we detect spam, malware, illegal content and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable their account or profile or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>We may use your child&rsquo;s information to provide recommendations, personalised content and customised search results. For example, depending on your child&rsquo;s settings, Google Play may use information, such as the apps that your child has installed, to suggest new apps that they might like.</p>
<p>In addition, we may combine the information that we collect among our services and across your child&rsquo;s devices for the purposes described above. Depending on your child&rsquo;s account or profile settings, their activity on other sites and apps may be associated with their personal information in order to improve Google&rsquo;s services.</p>
<p>Google will not serve&nbsp;<a href="https://g.co/FamilyLink/AdsInfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">personalised ads</a>&nbsp;to your child, which means that ads will not be based on information from your child&rsquo;s account or profile. Instead, ads may be based on information such as the content of the website or app that your child is viewing, the current search query or general location (such as city or county). When browsing the web or using non-Google apps, your child may encounter ads served by other (non-Google) ad providers, including ads personalised by third parties.</p>
